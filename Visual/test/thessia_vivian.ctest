# OSEHRA ViViAN Common Dashboard Script
#
# This script contains basic dashboard driver code common to all
# clients.
#
# Put this script in a directory such as "~/Dashboards/Scripts" or
# "c:/Dashboards/Scripts".  Create a file next to this script, say
# 'my_dashboard.cmake', with code of the following form:
#
#   # Client maintainer: me@mydomain.net
   set(CTEST_SITE "THESSIA")
   set(CTEST_BUILD_NAME "Win32-ViViAN")
#
#  
   set(VIVIAN_WEB_ROOT "http://thessia.kitware.com/Product-Management/instrumented")
   set(dashboard_root_name "D:/wamp/www")
   set(CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT "${dashboard_root_name}")
   set(dashboard_do_coverage ON)
   # Include the common dashboard script.
   include(${CTEST_SCRIPT_DIRECTORY}/vivian_common.cmake)

# Then run a scheduled task (cron job) with a command line such as
#
#   ctest -S ~/Dashboards/Scripts/my_dashboard.cmake -V
#
# By default the source and build trees will be placed in the path
# "../MyTests/" relative to your script location.
#
# The following variables may be set before including this script
# to configure it:
#
#   dashboard_model       = Nightly | Experimental | Continuous
#   dashboard_root_name   = Change name of "My Tests" directory
#   dashboard_source_name = Name of source directory (VistA)
#   dashboard_binary_name = Name of binary directory (VistA-build)
#   dashboard_CMakeCache  = Initial CMakeCache.txt file content
#   dashboard_do_coverage = True to enable coverage (ex: gcov)
#   dashboard_do_memcheck = True to enable memcheck (ex: valgrind)
#   CTEST_GIT_COMMAND     = path to git command-line client
#   CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS     = build tool arguments (ex: -j2)
#   CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT  = Where to put source and build trees
#   CTEST_TEST_TIMEOUT    = Per-test timeout length
#   CTEST_TEST_ARGS       = ctest_test args (ex: PARALLEL_LEVEL 4)
#   CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM    = Path to "make" tool to use
#
# Options to configure Git:
#   dashboard_git_url      = Custom git clone url
